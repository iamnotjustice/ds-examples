# Queue in Golang example

Similarly to *Stack*, we have two simplified examples of queue, using slice as well as using Linked List. All with the following operations:

- Enqueue
- Dequeue
- Peek

And again, for simplicity, we're gonna use stdlib List container for one type of queue, not a custom one.

To compare two implementations simply uncomment one and comment out the other in *main.go* file.
