Some simple data structure examples in Golang, contains: list, queue and stack.

For **Linked List** there's an example of a custom *Singly Linked List* and its stdlib counterpart (which is *Doubly Linked List* from "container/list").
For **Queue** and **Stack** there's an example of implementation using both *Linked List* and *Slice*.
