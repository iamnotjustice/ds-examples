# Linked Lists in Golang example

A simplified version of a custom Singly Linked List that contains methods like:

- Push Back
- Push Front
- Insert After
- Len
- Front
- Remove

With similar interface to the one that's inside stdlib's "container/list". 

And Node method **Next** which helps iterate over the collection.

You can uncomment the stdlib part in *main.go* file to compare the results between our custom one and stdlib one.
