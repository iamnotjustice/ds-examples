# Stack in Golang example

Two simplified examples of stack, using slice as well as using Linked List. All with the following operations:

- Push
- Pop
- Peek

For simplicity, we're gonna use stdlib List container for one type of stack, not a custom one.

To compare two implementations simply uncomment one and comment out the other in *main.go* file.
